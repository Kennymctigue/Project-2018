## Backround to the Iris Flower Dataset

According to [TechTarget](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/data-set), "A data set is a collection of related, discrete items of related data that may be accessed individually or in combination or managed as a whole entity".  The data itself could relate to anything from  money to nature, broad and comprehensive sample to narrow and restricted.  The most common layout for a dataset is in matrix form with the columns representing the variables and the rows giving the dataset members values for each variable. This is the layout of The Iris Flower Dataset which is the subject of this submission.

[The Iris Flower Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) is also known as [Fisher's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) Iris data set, after the British statistician and Biologist Ronald Fisher.
The dataset was compiled by taking 50 samples each of three different species of Iris flower, Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor.  For each sample taken four different measurements were recorded, the sepal length, the sepal width, the petal length and the petal width
